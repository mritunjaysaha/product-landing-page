        <h3><strong>OnePlus Concept One:</strong></h3>
        <p>
            Hi friends,
        </p>
        <p>
            Today, we finally unveiled our first-ever concept phone, the OnePlus Concept One, at CES 2020. The OnePlus
            Concept One is the first phone ever to use color-shifting glass technology (electrochromic glass
            technology), giving it an “invisible camera.” The device marks a breakthrough exploration in smartphone CMF
            (color, material, finish) design and lays the foundation for future smartphones with radically new designs
            and capabilities.
        </p>
        <p>
            The glass of the OnePlus Concept One uses organic particles to create changes in transparency so that the
            glass covering the camera lenses can shift in an instant from opaque black to entirely clear. Presenting a
            clean, unbroken surface when not in use, the “invisible” design is a manifest example of OnePlus’
            “burdenless” design philosophy. This optimal solution is what we call “Electronic CMF”—a new approach in
            industrial design.
        </p>
        <p>
            But the glass also provides a practical benefit, doubling as a built-in polarizing filter for the camera
            that allows users to achieve sharper, more finely detailed shots under strong light.
        </p>
        <p>
            We collaborated with our partner McLaren on the concept phone's design, drawing inspiration from similar
            technology used in McLaren's 720S luxury sports car, which features a glass roof panel that can alter its
            tint and control the amount of light allowed through. Additionally, the OnePlus Concept One design
            integrates both glass and leather, using the same stylish, premium quality leather specially tailored for
            McLaren’s own cars.
        </p>
        <p class="mclaren">
            <em>
                “At McLaren we select the best quality leathers produced in the UK, Ireland and Scotland. The soft
                grained semi-aniline leather, is soft to touch, and due to the nature of the natural grain this creates
                a beautifully silky haptic.Leather exudes luxury therefore was one of aspects of this OnePlus concept
                device that we were keen to offer our input. Our design at McLaren embraces the natural features of the
                leather through the subtle grain variation which adds character to each car – making each McLaren
                completely unique and therefore making this OnePlus concept device follow in a similar unique path.”
            </em>
        </p>
        <p>
            Although electrochromic glass has already been put to use in some limited applications in cars and in
            planes, miniaturizing the technology for use in phones took some extraordinary work on the part of OnePlus’
            R&D team.
        </p>

        <h5><strong>The Most Advanced Electrochromic Glass Ever Made</strong></h5>
        <p>
            One of the outstanding challenges was that the glass needed to be made exceptionally thin and light without
            leaving it fragile. Electrochromic glass is usually composed of two panels of glass with a color-shifting
            material in between them. For the OnePlus Concept One, we managed to achieve something far thinner than
            industry average: the glass panels are just 0.1mm each, for a combined total of only 0.35mm. That's as thin
            as a display glass protector film.  
        </p>
        <h5><strong>Fast Color Shifting – Only 0.7s</strong></h5> 
        <p>
            For the best, most effortless experience possible, the Concept One’s invisible camera was rigorously tested
            and calibrated for speed.  The OnePlus Concept One takes a mere 0.7s for the glass to transition from solid
            black to fully clear, faster even than the camera itself takes to fully activate, and it uses almost no
            power. We spent nearly eight months and tested more than a hundred different options before settling on the
            best solution for looks, speed, and power consumption. 
        </p>
        <h5><strong>Great Feel – No Detail Is Too Small</strong></h5>
        <p>
            Our hands are amazingly sensitive to even the most subtle differences in texture, and so a light,
            comfortable feel is a requisite for every product we make, including the OnePlus Concept One.  
        </p>
        <p>
            The leather covering across the back of the phone creates a sense of lightness, both visually and
            tactilely. 
        </p>
        <p>
            With this unique invisible camera, we aimed at creating an elegant solution to the challenges of camera
            design in smartphones today. After setting a new benchmark for smartphone displays by creating the
            industry’s first 90 Hz QHD+ AMOLED display, the OnePlus Concept One now marks one more step into the future
            of the smartphone industry, and is proof of OnePlus’s commitment and leadership in innovation.

        <h3>Specification</h3>
        <p>
            Because this is essentially the OnePlus 7T Pro in new skin, the specifications are the same. That means a
            Snapdragon 855+ processor, 12GB RAM and a 4,085mAh battery with 30W fast-charging.
        </p>
        <p>
            Just like it did with the OnePlus 7 Pro, 7T and 7T Pro, OnePlus has used a 90Hz refresh rate panel for the
            display, enabling smooth animation and gesture response.

        </p>
        <p>
            As you'd suspect, the screen is the same resolution and size as the 7T Pro. Specifically, that means a
            6.67-inch panel with curved edges and quad HD resolution (1440 x 3120).

        </p>
        <p>
            Likewise, the triple camera on the back features the same specs as the 7T Pro. That means a 48-megapixel
            main sensor with OIS, plus the 3x Zoom 8-megapixel camera and a 16-megapixel ultra-wide camera.

        </p>
        <p>
            While the glass is cool to look at, it also doubles as an ND filter for the camera, which is genuinely
            useful, particularly in harsh lighting conditions or when you'd like to have a different look to your shots.
